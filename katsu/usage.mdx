description: Using Katsu to build images
---

To build an image, you need to create a YAML "Manifest" file. This file describes the partition layout
(if you are building a disk image), packages to install, and scripts to run during the build process.


To run Katsu, you simply need to specify the entrypoint manifest file, along with the desired output format:

```bash
katsu build -o disk-image manifest.yaml
```
